# WordPress REST API Plugin

This WordPress plugin aims to provide a robust REST API, facilitating the development of Android apps or any other software requiring interaction with WordPress-based websites. With this plugin, developers can easily access and manipulate WordPress data programmatically, enabling seamless integration with various platforms and applications.

## Features

- Exposes WordPress data through a RESTful API.
- Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for posts, pages, categories, tags, and more.
- Authentication mechanisms for secure API access.
- Customizable endpoints to suit specific project requirements.
- Simple configuration and setup process.

## Usage

To use this plugin:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or server.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin.

Once activated, you can start using the REST API endpoints to interact with your WordPress site programmatically. Here are some common operations:

- **Fetching Posts**: `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts`
- **Creating a Post**: `POST /wp-json/wp/v2/posts`
- **Updating a Post**: `PUT /wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{id}`
